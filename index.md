# Ryan Wong: User Page

## Introduction
Hello, and welcome to my page! My name is **Ryan Wong** and I am a ~~second~~ third-year Computer Science student in Revelle College (Where has time gone?). I was born and raised in **Oakland, California**! This page will introduce my [professional interests](#professional-interests) as well as my [current hobbies](#hobbies).


## Professional Interests
I am currently interested in software development, more specifically *back-end and server-side development*. My first and favorite programming language is **Java**, but I am always open to learning and utilizing the many languages out there today. My favorite line of code is:
```
System.out.println("Hello, World!);
```
So simple and yet so clean.


## Hobbies
Outside of the classroom, my two main hobbies at the moment are **working out and DJing**. 

1. ***Working Out***
   
   If there is one thing you should know about me, it is that I **love** to go to the gym. I find that lifting every day has not only improved my physical health, but has also improved my mental health and overall wellbeing. 
   
   Here is a short GIF of me in Fall of 2022 deadlifting 530 pounds:

   ***WOW!*** That was a lot of weight to carry. But, as I always like to say:
   > PR or ER!

   (The joke was that I will either hit a new personal record, or get sent to the ER trying. <sup>Ha..</sup> ha.. <sub>ha...</sub>)
2. ***DJing***

   As for **DJing**, I love to mix *EDM and House* music! I love to play music for my friends or introduce people to music they've never heard before. I also post some of my short mixes on [SoundCloud](https://on.soundcloud.com/9jg6U). Some of my favorite EDM artists (in no specific order) are:
   - Seven Lions
   - Kompany
   - Wooli
   - Subtronics

   ...and many more! I am still finding new music all the time and will rue the day I run out of new music to listen to.

## Conclusion
Thank you for visiting my page! I hope this brief page gave you a quick introduction to my professional interests and extracurricular hobbies. Time to check this off my bucket list!
